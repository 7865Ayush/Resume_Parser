This project is a Resume Parser that automatically extracts and analyzes key information from resumes such as name, contact details, education, skills, and experience.
The goal is to simplify the process of shortlisting candidates by converting unstructured resume text into structured data.
Unlike typical NLP-only approaches, this project combines both Machine Learning models and traditional  algorithms  to improve accuracy and handle diverse resume formats.
